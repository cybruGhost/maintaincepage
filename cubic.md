> 🎵 **Cubic Music** is an evolving streaming app focused on smooth music playback and user experience.  
> - While it might not be as polished as some mature apps yet, it's a solid, good-looking, and lightweight alternative.  
> - The project is maintained and will only be updated when I fix bugs or add features as I learn Kotlin skills!

## 🚀 New in v1.8.0 — *Spotify Canvas (beta)*

**What is Spotify Canvas?**

> Spotify Canvas is a short, looping visual (3–8 second video) that appears in place of static album artwork while a song is playing. Instead of a still image, listeners see a subtle, animated visual that enhances the mood and identity of the track.
> 
> *Canvas videos are silent, vertical, and loop seamlessly — designed to complement music without distracting from it.*
